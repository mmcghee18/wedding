	<h3>Getting there</h3>
	<p>
		For out of town guests, we recommend flying into San Francisco (SFO) or San
		Jose (SJC) airports.
	</p>
	<p>
		From there, you can drive down to Ben Lomond and Santa Cruz - it is about an
		hour and a half from SFO and 45 minutes from SJC.

			<strong>Important note about driving to Waterfall Lodge:</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Waterfall Lodge has limited parking and does not allow people to park
			onsite unless they're staying there overnight. If you're staying elsewhere
			on Saturday night, we have a shuttle that will pick you up ~5 minutes out
			from Waterfall Lodge and bring you in. The shuttle pick-up is at this
			address: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZDKXz6fA4psmTPGC7"
				>St Peter & St Paul Orthodox</a
			>. Plan to catch a shuttle around 2:30pm, stay tuned for more details.
		</p>

		<p>
			The shuttles will also bring guests back to their cars at the end of the
			reception.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you stay in a cabin on Saturday night after the ceremony (see info
			below), you are able to drive into and park at Waterfall Lodge.
