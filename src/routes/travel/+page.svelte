	<h3>Getting to Waterfall Lodge</h3>
	<p>
		Waterfall Lodge has limited parking and does not allow people to park onsite
		unless they're staying there overnight. If you're staying elsewhere on
		Saturday night, we have a shuttle that will pick you up ~5 minutes out from
		Waterfall Lodge and bring you in. The shuttle pick-up is at this address: <a
			href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZDKXz6fA4psmTPGC7"
			target="_blank">St Peter & St Paul Orthodox</a
		>. You should park in the green zone on the map below.
		<strong>Plan to catch a shuttle between 2:15 - 2:45pm.</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
		The shuttles will also bring guests back to their cars at the end of the
		reception. The earliest shuttle will leave at 8:30pm. The latest shuttles
		will run until 1am bringing guests to and from the afterparty.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you're staying in a cabin on Saturday night after the ceremony, can just
		drive into and park at Waterfall Lodge. You can arrive as early as 1pm.
	</p>

	<h3>Airports</h3>
	<p>
		For out of town guests, we recommend flying into San Francisco (SFO) or San
		Jose (SJC) airports.
	</p>
	<p>
		From there, you can drive down to Ben Lomond and Santa Cruz - it is about an
		hour and a half from SFO and 45 minutes from SJC.
	</p>
	<p>
		Reach out at <strong>michellemegan.2024@gmail.com</strong> if you need help coordinating
		a ride from the airport.
