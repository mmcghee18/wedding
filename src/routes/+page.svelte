<p>
	In choosing each other, imperfections and all, we find deep meaning and joy
	and begin the journey of forging a new family unit.
</p>
<p>We would be honored to have you present as we affirm this commitment.</p>

<p>
	We're so excited to get married on the first day of Pride Month! It's 2024, a
	time when a queer couple getting married is wonderfully ordinary.
</p>
<p>
	At the same time, it's an opportunity to reflect on those who fought
	(recently!) for this right, and continue to fight for the freedom and
	acceptance we all deserve.
</p>
<p>This event is a celebration of queer love and the families we create.</p>
