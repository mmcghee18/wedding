		hour and a half from SFO and 45 minutes from SJC.</p> <p>Reach out at <strong>michellemegan.2024@gmail.com</strong> if you need help coordinating
		a ride from the airport. We&#39;ll do our best to connect people who could potentially

			onsite unless they&#39;re staying there overnight. If you&#39;re staying elsewhere
			on Saturday night, we have a shuttle that will pick you up ~5 minutes out
			from Waterfall Lodge and bring you in. The shuttle pick-up is at this
			address: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZDKXz6fA4psmTPGC7">St Peter &amp; St Paul Orthodox</a>. Plan to catch a shuttle around 2:30pm, stay tuned for more details.</p> <p>The shuttles will also bring guests back to their cars at the end of the
