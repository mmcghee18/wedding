By which we mean, something special and fancy, but also reasonable to wear in the woods.

Waterfall Lodge does not allow people to park onsite unless they're staying there overnight.

So, on Saturday, you'll park in the parking lot of a church that is 5 minutes from Waterfall Lodge. Here's the address: <a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZDKXz6fA4psmTPGC7'>St Peter & St Paul Orthodox</a>.

From there, a shuttle will pick you up and bring you to Waterfall Lodge for the ceremony and reception. The shuttles will also bring guests back to their cars at the end of the night.

If you're staying onsite on Saturday, you can park at Waterfall Lodge.`}]]}class re extends A{constructor(e){super(),L(this,e,te,ee,z,{})}}export{re as component};
