		unless they&#39;re staying there overnight. If you&#39;re staying elsewhere on
		Saturday night, we have a shuttle that will pick you up ~5 minutes out from
		Waterfall Lodge and bring you in. The shuttle pick-up is at this address: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZDKXz6fA4psmTPGC7" target="_blank">St Peter &amp; St Paul Orthodox</a>. You should park in the green zone on the map below.
		<strong>Plan to catch a shuttle between 2:15 - 2:45pm.</strong></p> <img src="church.png" style="width: 500px; align-self: center"/> <p>The shuttles will also bring guests back to their cars at the end of the
		reception. The earliest shuttle will leave at 8:30pm. The latest shuttles
		will run until 1am bringing guests to and from the afterparty.</p> <p>If you&#39;re staying in a cabin on Saturday night after the ceremony, can just
		drive into and park at Waterfall Lodge. You can arrive as early as 1pm.</p> <h3 class="svelte-18w2sw">Airports</h3> <p>For out of town guests, we recommend flying into San Francisco (SFO) or San
		Jose (SJC) airports.</p> <p>From there, you can drive down to Ben Lomond and Santa Cruz - it is about an
		hour and a half from SFO and 45 minutes from SJC.</p> <p>Reach out at <strong>michellemegan.2024@gmail.com</strong> if you need help coordinating
